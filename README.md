# k\_success\_rates

Some quick exploratory looks at the [NIH Success Rates
data](https://report.nih.gov/success_rates/) for early career awards
(i.e,. “K-awards”).

## Warning

This was started fairly quickly over a lunch break — it almost certainly
has errors.

## Future plans

None for now but as I get more serious about applying, I might
eventually turn this into a Shiny app and do more thorough analyses.
You’re welcome to fork and do this if you’re
interested.

# Plots

## How many applicants and what is the success rate for K-awards?

## But can you use `gganimate`?
