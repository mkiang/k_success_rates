# k_success_rates

Some quick exploratory looks at the [NIH Success Rates data](https://report.nih.gov/success_rates/) for early career awards (i.e,. "K-awards"). 

## Warning

This was started fairly quickly over a lunch break â€” it almost certainly has errors. 

## Shiny app

I've made a very crude Shiny app. To run it, use the following command *on your local RStudio instance*:

```
shiny::runGitHub("mkiang/k_success_rates")
```

# Plots

## How much has the NIH awarded in early career grants over time?

## How much has been awarded by all those things *and* funding mechanism?

## How many applicants and what is the success rate for K-awards?

## But can you use `gganimate`?
